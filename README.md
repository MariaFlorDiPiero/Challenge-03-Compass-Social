This is the Challenge 03 â€“ Compass Social readme.

The challenge was implemented in nest.js. Users, comments and posts routes were created. And authentication was done using JWT, with a 12 hour expiration.

The localhost:3000/api/v2/users/login endpoint has been implemented for the post route to the frontend.

The password that must be placed must be a strong password, as a regex was used for validation.

In masterBranch is the nest.js backend project and in reactBranch is the frontend project.

In the frontend project, the home screen is not finished.
